The business challenge described for AppleBite Co. involves automating the entire software deployment pipeline from code push to GitHub to the production environment. The company needs to implement Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) processes with DevOps using Jenkins, Git, Docker, and Ansible. The solution should handle the following:

Automating Code Deployment: On every push to the Git master branch, the following should happen automatically:
A fresh test server should be provisioned with necessary software.
The code should be containerized.
The code should be deployed to a test server.
Once validated on the test server, the same code should be pushed to production.
Here’s how you can approach automating this solution:

Steps for Executing the Solution
1. Set Up the Jenkins Environment
Master VM for Jenkins: This will handle CI/CD and orchestrate jobs for building, testing, and deploying the application.
Jenkins Slave Node (Test Server): A fresh instance (e.g., an EC2 instance or VM) that will act as the test server.
You will need to install:

Jenkins Master (on the first VM)
Jenkins Slave Node (Test server that can be provisioned on-demand)
2. Jenkins Configuration
Install Build Pipeline Plugin and Post-build Task Plugin on the Jenkins Master VM to create a pipeline.
Steps for configuring Jenkins:

Set up a Jenkins pipeline to trigger automatically when code is pushed to the GitHub master branch.
Use GitHub Webhooks to integrate Jenkins and GitHub to listen for changes in the master branch.
3. Slave Node Setup
Manually install python, openssh-server, and git on the Jenkins Slave Node to allow Jenkins to communicate with the slave.
Steps:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python git openssh-server
4. Docker Configuration
Use Docker to containerize the PHP application and deploy it.
Steps for Docker setup on the test server:

Create a Dockerfile to build the container for the PHP application.
Use the devopsedu/webapp Docker image and add your PHP website files into it.
Example Dockerfile:

Dockerfile
Copy code
FROM devopsedu/webapp
COPY ./your-php-website /var/www/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["apache2-foreground"]
5. Ansible Configuration for Docker Installation
Job 1: Install and configure the Puppet Agent on the slave node.
Job 2: Use Ansible to configure the slave node by installing Docker on it. This can be done by creating an Ansible playbook to install Docker on the test server.
Example Ansible playbook to install Docker:

yaml
Copy code
---
- name: Install Docker on test server
  hosts: test-server
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Update apt cache
      apt:
        update_cache: yes

    - name: Install Docker
      apt:
        name: docker.io
        state: present

    - name: Start Docker service
      service:
        name: docker
        state: started
6. Pipeline Creation in Jenkins
In Jenkins, set up the following jobs in your pipeline:

Job 1: Install and configure Puppet Agent on the test server.

This job will run a shell script to install and configure Puppet on the slave node.
Job 2: Use Ansible to configure the test server and install Docker.

This job will use Ansible to ensure that Docker is installed and configured on the test server.
Job 3: Deploy the PHP website:

Pull the PHP website and Dockerfile from the Git repository.
Build the Docker image and deploy it to the test server.
Run tests to validate the deployment.
Sample Jenkins pipeline script for Job 3:

groovy
Copy code
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build Docker Image') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/edureka-devops/projCert.git'
                script {
                    sh 'docker build -t php_app:latest .'
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy Docker Image') {
            steps {
                script {
                    sh 'docker run -d -p 80:80 my-php-app'
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Test Deployment') {
            steps {
                script {
                    sh 'curl -f http://localhost'
                }
            }
        }
    }
    post {
        failure {
            script {
                sh 'docker rm -f $(docker ps -q --filter "ancestor=my-php-app")'
            }
        }
    }
}
Job 4: If Job 3 fails, the Post-Build Task can be used to automatically remove the container deployed on the test server.

7. GitHub Integration with Jenkins
Create a GitHub webhook to trigger the Jenkins pipeline every time code is pushed to the master branch.
In GitHub:

Go to Settings → Webhooks → Add webhook.
Set the payload URL to your Jenkins server.
Set content type as application/json.
Select Just the push event.
In Jenkins:

Set up the GitHub plugin to listen for push events from GitHub and trigger the pipeline.
8. Deploy to Production
After successfully testing the deployment on the test server, you can push the container to production by adding additional stages in the Jenkins pipeline.

Conclusion
By implementing the solution with Jenkins, Git, Docker, and Ansible, you automate the process of deploying code to the test server and production with minimal manual intervention. The Jenkins pipeline ensures that:

The code is built and tested on the test server.
A Docker container is deployed and validated.
The deployment process is fully automated, allowing faster feedback and higher reliability in the delivery process.
